- console.log() for debugging
- Special Characters (\n, \t)
- Comments in code
- Operators (Arithmetic, Relational, Logical)
- Type Coercion (Type Conversion)
- Short-circuit Evaluation:
  - In AND (&&): If first input is false, it doesn't evaluate the second input and immediately returns the first input
  - If first input is true, the second input is evaluated and returned
- Special Number Values:
  - 0 and -0
  - NaN (Not A Number) - Used when a situation is bound to return a number, but there's no valid possible number to return

**Control Flow & Logic:**
- If-else statements
- Nested Conditions
- Loops

**Programming Concepts:**
- DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)

**Project Work:**
Built frontend pages for an E-commerce website:
