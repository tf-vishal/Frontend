- Abstract Operations
    - These are some set of algorithm that is present in the ECMA scropt docs, but they are not available for usage in ECMA script (i.e we as devlopers cannot
    use these operations directly)
    - They are mentioned in docs to aid(help) the documentation only.
    in the ecma docs, there are alot of things that are done by the language internally.Those are just to explain the internal functioning.


- Coercion (TYPE CONVERSION)
    - whenever we do an operation, based on the input we can actually convert(convert type of input) the input for operation. THis conversion can be manuallyd one by us (Explicit Typecasting) or the language based on some certain rules automatically converts the type (Implicit Typecasting/Coercion). [TypeCasting/Type COnversion ]


- Abstract Operations
    - ToNumber 
    - ToPrimitive
        converts the input to non-object type
