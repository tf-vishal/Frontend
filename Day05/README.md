# Day 05 - CSS Concepts Revisited & IaC

## 📅 Date
January 7, 2026

## 🎯 Topics Covered

### CSS Fundamentals (Revisited)

#### Default Styles
- Understanding browser default styles
- CSS resets and normalization
- Why different browsers render differently

#### Layout Systems
- **Flexbox** - One-dimensional layouts
  - Flex container and flex items
  - Main axis and cross axis alignment
  - Flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis
- **Grid** - Two-dimensional layouts
  - Grid container and grid items
  - Rows and columns
  - Grid template areas
  - Gap properties

#### Advanced CSS
- **SVG** - Scalable Vector Graphics
  - Embedding SVGs in HTML
  - Styling SVGs with CSS
  - Responsive SVG implementation
- **CSS Functions**
  - `calc()` - Mathematical calculations
  - `var()` - CSS custom properties
  - `min()`, `max()`, `clamp()` - Responsive values
  - Color functions: `rgb()`, `hsl()`, etc.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Concept** - Managing infrastructure through code
- **Benefits** - Version control, reproducibility, automation
- **Application** - Applied IaC principles to my current project
- Understanding how IaC improves deployment and scalability

## 💡 Key Takeaways
- Flexbox vs Grid: Use flexbox for one-dimensional layouts, grid for two-dimensional
- CSS functions make responsive design much easier
- SVGs are resolution-independent and CSS-styleable
- IaC principles help organize and maintain projects better
- Revisiting concepts reveals things you missed the first time

## 🛠️ Practice
- Re-implemented layouts using both flexbox and grid
- Experimented with CSS functions for responsive sizing
- Integrated SVG graphics into project
- Applied IaC concepts to project structure

## 📝 Notes
- Default styles can be overridden with CSS resets (normalize.css, reset.css)
- Grid is not a replacement for flexbox - they work together
- `clamp(min, preferred, max)` is powerful for fluid typography
- SVGs can be manipulated with CSS just like HTML elements
- IaC thinking: treat your code infrastructure like your application code

## 🚀 Current Project Status
Working on applying these concepts to my ongoing project. IaC principles are helping keep things organized and scalable.

## 🔜 Next Steps
- Continue building project with better layout understanding
- Explore more advanced CSS Grid techniques
- Dive deeper into IaC implementation
- Practice combining flexbox and grid in real layouts
